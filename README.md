# PORTFOLIO 2.0

## Personal portfolio website

- Welcome to Woo-Sik's portfolio website

- Portfolio 2.0 was built with ReactJS. Same design concept was brought to this new portfolio website from [my original portfolio](https://dvlprwchoi.github.io/portfolio). However, lots of codes were refactored and cleaned.

- This website has a mobile responsive design depends on device's screen size. It was built with ReactJS from scratch. You can explorer my projects by simply clicking screenshots under project section!
